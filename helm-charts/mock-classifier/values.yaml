#appSettings/environment values
appSettings:
  # Please place any non-secret app settings/config values here, these correspond to the values in the
  # appsettings.json file (.Net), double underscore (__) correspond to a nested field e.g.
  # '"object" : { "key": "value" }' is equivalent to 'object__key: value'
  
appSecrets:
  # PLEASE DO NOT LIST ANY APP SECRETS HERE! THIS IS A PUBLIC REPO, HARDCODED SECRETS CAN BE PUBLICLY READ
  # For any app secrets e.g. database key, typically stored in the appsettings.json (.Net),
  # please feed them as pipeline style secrets through the Github workflow file reusable-k8s-deployment.yml
  # this is a place holder object, so they will be overwritten through the helm commands.
  # In helm syntax this would be for example: helm upgrade --install ... --set secrets.mockClassifier.cosmosDbKey=${{ secrets.CosmosDbKey }}.
  # Please also ensure you capture any secrets in the secrets.yaml manifest under the data object e.g.
  #  data:
  #    testKey: {{ default "" .Values.cosmosDbKey | b64enc | quote }}
  # Also reference the secret key from the secrets object e.g.
  #  APP__TESTSECRET:
  #    secretName: app-appsettings-secrets
  #    secretKey: testKey
